3. **Continuous Music Playback:** Even when users navigate to other tabs, such as Favorites, the music will continue playing, ensuring an uninterrupted listening experience.

4. **Dynamic Background Color:** The background gradient color changes according to the cover image of the currently playing song, adding an aesthetic touch to the music player.

5. **Fluid Animations and Transitions:** The interface is enriched with animations and transitions, such as list loading skeletons, animations and background color change animations, making the application feel dynamic and engaging.

6. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for their favorite songs or artists, making it easy to find and play the desired music.

7. **Music Controls:** The music player provides controls to play, pause, skip to the next or previous track, and adjust the playback using the seeker (progress bar).

8. **Tab Switching:** Users can switch between tabs, such as "For You" and "Top Tracks," to explore different song categories.
